# Cozmo
This project was my senior thesis for a Robotics Engineering degree at UCSC. The implementation was on Cozmo, a robot from Anki.
My advisor and I decided that using some of the built in API functions for testing and implementation would make the project
much more reasonable for a undergraduate.

The files present are first a test of things we could do with Cozmo, that is the 910 file. We basically use openCV and openGL to 
grab an image from the camera, apply some filters, reproduce the image with edge detection, and draw a green line of the streamed 
video image to show that a GUI was possible.

Next is the 600 file, which is a first at navigating to an object.
Then the implementation of the control algoritm is the 555 file. (The passed Thesis)
